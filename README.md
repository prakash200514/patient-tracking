The AI-Powered Patient Health Record and Treatment Tracking System is a web-based healthcare management platform designed to digitally store, manage, and analyze patient medical data in a centralized and secure environment. The system allows patients to register, maintain personal health profiles, record symptoms, upload medical reports, view prescriptions, and track treatment history, while doctors can access complete patient records, diagnose conditions, prescribe medications, and monitor treatment progress over time. An integrated Artificial Intelligence module analyzes historical health data, symptoms, and treatment outcomes to predict possible diseases, assess health risks, generate early warning alerts, and provide decision-support insights for doctors, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and proactive care. The admin module manages users, ensures data integrity, and maintains system security. By combining modern web technologies with machine learning-based intelligence, the system reduces manual errors, enhances patient engagement, supports data-driven medical decisions, and transforms traditional reactive healthcare into a predictive, efficient, and patient-centric digital healthcare ecosystem.
